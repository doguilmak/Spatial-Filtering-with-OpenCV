<h2>Project Summary</h2>

<p>Spatial operations use pixels in a neighborhood to determine the present pixel value. Applications include filtering and sharpening. They are used in many steps in computer vision like segmentation and are a key building block in Artificial Intelligence algorithms. In this repositroy, you can see examples about usage of spatial operations in image processing.  Rendering may take a long time or give an error. In this case, please refresh the page and wait for it to open again. The information acquired under this project was entirely acquired by IBM.</p>
