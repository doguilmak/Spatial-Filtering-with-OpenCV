# Geometric Operations and Mathematical Tools with OpenCV Library

## Project Summary

Spatial operations use pixels in a neighborhood to determine the present pixel value. Applications include filtering and sharpening. They are used in many steps in computer vision like segmentation and are a key building block in Artificial Intelligence algorithms. In this repositroy, you can see examples about usage of spatial operations in image processing.  All details are in **spatial_filtering.ipynb** file. The information acquired under this project was entirely acquired by **IBM**.

## How to Run Code

Before running the code make sure that you have these libraries:

 - matplotlib
 - numpy
 - opencv
